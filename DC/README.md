# Chinese Checkers
RULE OF CHINESE CHECKERS
To win the game is to move all your pieces across the board to the opposite star point, directly across from where you started.
Each point of the star will a colored set of marbles for each player. You may move one space, or jump over a number of any color marbles. You must follow the lines on the board when moving and jumping. Only move one space, or over one marble at a time. Jump one marble and then continue to jump one marble at a time, as long as there is an empty space to jump to.
if a player is unable to move any of their marbles, they must forfeit the game and loose. At this point the loosing player removes his marbles and the other players continue to play chinese checkers
